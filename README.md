INTRODUCTION

This Python 3.8 script automatically downloads COVID-19 data from Our World in Data, reconstructs it, exports it in CSV files and create a scatter plot nimatied throughout time to show the evolution of each country.



REQUIREMENTS

Python 3.8 with datetime, matplotlib, numpy, os, pathlib, time, tkinter and urllib modules installed



USING IT

Open it using a Python interpreter, compile it and run Main_script()
It should take between 10 and 20 minutes (creating matplotlib objects is really slow)
